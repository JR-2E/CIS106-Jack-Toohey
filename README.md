# CIS106-Jack-Toohey

## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because programming interests me as a video game player, and also because I need it to progress in my degree.
I chose Python because it has been recommended to me by multiple people. 
From what I have heard, Python is not too difficult to learn, and it can be useful.
If I am honest, I do not know how or when I will ever use this.
I hope to one day learn to use or program on TempleOS.

## Assignment 2

This assignment was to make a program that displays "Hello World!" then change it to our name. I learned the basic process for making a code, from planning it out to writing the actual code. I learned about the tools that are used in this process. I have been playing with programiz online IDE, but I haven't tried any others yet.
