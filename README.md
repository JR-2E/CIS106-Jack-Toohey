# CIS106-Jack-Toohey

## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because programming interests me as a video game player, and also because I need it to progress in my degree.
I chose Python because it has been recommended to me by multiple people. 
From what I have heard, Python is not too difficult to learn, and it can be useful.
If I am honest, I do not know how or when I will ever use this.
I hope to one day learn to use or program on TempleOS.

## Assignment 2

This assignment was to make a program that displays "Hello World!" then change it to our name. I learned the basic process for making a code, from planning it out to writing the actual code. I learned about the tools that are used in this process. I have been playing with programiz online IDE, but I haven't tried any others yet. I do not know when I will be needing this knowledge in my future. The programming in my field of work/degree is very different from any of these languages. I'm sure I will use it at some point at home, as I have a computer that I use for work and school often, and I used to game with. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do the latter anymore.

## Assignment 3

In this assignment, I learned about constants, variables, and data types. The codes that I make for machines uses mostly (if not completely) constants. There are variables in the programming of the machine itself, which I do not work with (on a CNC lathe, the machine adjusts the RPM depending on the current position of the tool to keep the cut speed constant). It is possible that I will work with this one day.
