# CIS106-Jack-Toohey

## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because programming interests me as a video game player, and also because I need it to progress in my degree.
I chose Python because it has been recommended to me by multiple people. 
From what I have heard, Python is not too difficult to learn, and it can be useful.
If I am honest, I do not know how or when I will ever use this.
I hope to one day learn to use or program on TempleOS.

## Assignment 2

This assignment was to make a program that displays "Hello World!" then change it to our name. I learned the basic process for making a code, from planning it out to writing the actual code. I learned about the tools that are used in this process. I have been playing with programiz online IDE, but I haven't tried any others yet. I do not know when I will be needing this knowledge in my future. The programming in my field of work/degree is very different from any of these languages. I'm sure I will use it at some point at home, as I have a computer that I use for work and school often, and I used to game with. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to do the latter anymore.

## Assignment 3

In this assignment, I learned about constants, variables, and data types. The codes that I make for machines uses mostly (if not completely) constants. There are variables in the programming of the machine itself, which I do not work with (on a CNC lathe, the machine adjusts the RPM depending on the current position of the tool to keep the cut speed constant). It is possible that I will work with this one day. 

## Assignment 4

In this assignment, I practiced writing a program for Python without generating it through Flowgorithm. I spaced out/separated different parts of the program to make it easier to edit/understand what's going on in certain parts of the program. I also added notes before each section. These are both things I do when writing CNC code by hand (which I do not do much of anymore). There was not much more new material between last week and this week, so I cannot say I really learned anything this week to be honest.

## Assignment 5

In this assignment, I practices writing a program for Python using modular programming. It took a good amount of messing around in an IDE. I tried to use the example code as a guide but that did not work well. In CNC programming, a "canned cycle" is a line of code that has more actions than just one line would normally include. These are very common and are used in almost every code. The difference is that they require all the information in one line, instead of in separate lines like this. 

## Assignment 6

In this assignment, I got more practice writing a program for Python using modular programming. I like modular programming, because it seems like it can be used in many more applications when compared to the way we were programming before. It will be interesting to start making programs where some of them are not used, such as the activity in which the program asks what kind of shape the user wants to calculate the area of. 

## Assignment 7

In this assignment, I made a modular program in which some of the functions are not always used. I had thought this would be the next step, and it was not too confusing as learning modular programming was at first. I would think it would be difficult to make a program like this without using modular programming. 

## Assignment 8

In this assignment, I learned about and started to use loops in programs. Loops (so far) seem to be a pretty straight-forward concept. A part of the program is looped until a count reaches a certain value. I have made programs for CNC machines that use canned cycles, which can have loops, where only some values change. For example, to make a circular pocket going down in the Z coordinate in a piece of metal, the same chunk of program is used, but the Z coordinate changes until it reaches a certain value (the Z value originally given to the machine). This is automatically done in a loop, in a part of a program called a canned cycle.

## Assignment 9

In this assignment, I practiced more While loops, and included one in a program that I had already made for a previous assignment. Honestly, the most difficult part for me this week was trying to figure out how alter the number that my program guessed (Activity 1). There was not much different this week from last week.

## Assignment 10

In this assignment, I practiced a new kind of loop. This loop is useful because it includes a couple parts of the loop that you would normally have to create manually, like the count amount/limit. Other than that, it was not very much different from the other normal loops that we had worked on. 

## Assignment 11

In this assignment, I learned about/ started working with arrays. Arrays are useful for storing an *array* of information for later use.
They can also be used to sort information, like I did in the Activity 1 highest/lowest/average grade assignment. When programming CNC machines at work, coordinates and other values can be saved in a section of the code as reference values, to be used at a later time in the program. Instead of putting the whole coordinate in every time, you save them as a reference value, and substitute the coordinate for the reference value later the program. 

## Assignment 12

In this assignment, I used dynamic arrays. There was not much programming to be done from scratch, because the activities for this week were based around programs from previous weeks. Dynamic arrays seem very useful. The only reason I would think you would need static arrays is for when you only need a specific amount of inputs, or you do not want to rely on the user to end the process of adding to the array.
